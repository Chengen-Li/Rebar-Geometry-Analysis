# Rebar Geometry Analysis and 2D/3D Classification

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for detecting rebar intersections, generating grid lines using PCA and Hough Transform, and classifying imagery into 2D or 3D structures using a ResNet-based fusion model (RGB + Geometric/Depth features).

## 🚀 Features

- **Intersection Detection**: High-precision detection of rebar nodes using YOLO.
- **Automated Line Generation**: Intelligent linking of nodes into structural grids using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Noise Filtering**: Robust line pruning using Hough Transform and angular mode detection.
- **Multimodal Classification**: A ResNet-18 based classifier that fuses RGB image data with 10-dimensional geometric and depth features.
- **Two-Stage Decision Logic**: Enhanced 2D/3D prediction with a dedicated "Depth Gate" for high-reliability results in uncertain cases.

## 💻 Usage
### 1. Generate Structural LinesTo detect rebar nodes and generate line segments from your images (stored in getline_image/):Bashpython gen_line.py
### 2. Perform 2D/3D ClassificationTo classify your images using the trained ResNet model (integrating RGB and Depth data):Bashpython 2d3d_with_depth_predict.py --folder ./your_images --depth_dir ./your_depth_maps
## 📊 MethodologyLine Extraction PipelineNode Detection: YOLO identifies rebar intersections.PCA Alignment: Determines the dominant horizontal and vertical axes of the rebar grid.Hough Grouping: Refines line segments and groups them based on geometric consistency.Classification LogicThe system evaluates the probability of an image being 3D based on a two-stage threshold:Confident Zone: Direct classification if $P(3D) \geq 0.70$ or $P(3D) \leq 0.30$.Gray Zone: If the model is uncertain (between $0.3$ and $0.7$), a Depth Gate is triggered. This gate analyzes depth variance, gradients, and ROI ring differences to make the final determination.
